            { "type": "heading", "text": "Key Rules to Remember" },
            { "type": "list", "items": [
                "<strong>Compound Subjects (joined by 'and'):</strong> When two or more subjects are joined by 'and', they are usually plural and take a plural verb. <em>(e.g., 'Rohan <strong>and</strong> Priya <strong>are</strong> good friends.' 'The cat <strong>and</strong> the dog <strong>are</strong> playing.')</em> However, if the two subjects form a single idea or refer to the same person, the verb is singular. <em>(e.g., 'Bread <strong>and</strong> butter <strong>is</strong> his favourite breakfast.' 'The famous poet <strong>and</strong> philosopher <strong>has</strong> arrived.')</em>",
                "<strong>Subjects Joined by Or/Nor (Proximity Rule):</strong> When subjects are joined by 'or', 'nor', 'either...or', or 'neither...nor', the verb agrees with the subject that is closer to it. <em>(e.g., 'Neither the students nor the <strong>teacher is</strong> happy.' vs. 'Neither the teacher nor the <strong>students are</strong> happy.' 'Either my cousins or my <strong>aunt is</strong> going to host the party.')</em>",
                "<strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Most indefinite pronouns are singular and take a singular verb. These include `each`, `every`, `everyone`, `anybody`, `someone`, `no one`, `either`, and `neither`. <em>(e.g., '<strong>Everyone wants</strong> to win.' '<strong>Each</strong> of the mangoes <strong>is</strong> ripe.' '<strong>Somebody has</strong> left their wallet.')</em> A few (like `some`, `all`, `any`, `most`, `none`) can be singular or plural depending on the noun they refer to. <em>(e.g., '<strong>Some</strong> of the cake <strong>is</strong> missing.' vs. '<strong>Some</strong> of the students <strong>are</strong> late.')</em>",
                "<strong>Collective Nouns:</strong> Nouns like `team`, `family`, `group`, `committee`, and `audience` can be singular or plural. The verb is singular if the group acts as a single unit, but plural if the members act as individuals. <em>(e.g., 'The <strong>team is</strong> winning.' vs. 'The <strong>team are</strong> arguing amongst themselves.' 'The <strong>jury has</strong> reached a verdict.' vs 'The <strong>jury were</strong> divided in their opinions.')</em>",
                "<strong>Phrases Between Subject and Verb:</strong> The verb agrees with the main subject, not with a noun in a phrase that comes between them. Ignore intervening phrases starting with words like `along with`, `as well as`, `in addition to`, `besides`, `together with`. <em>(e.g., 'The <strong>politician</strong>, along with the newsmen, <strong>is</strong> expected shortly.' 'The <strong>box</strong> of sweets <strong>is</strong> on the table.' 'The <strong>colours</strong> of the rainbow <strong>are</strong> beautiful.')</em>",
                "<strong>Nouns Plural in Form but Singular in Meaning:</strong> Some nouns end in '-s' but are treated as singular subjects. This includes names of subjects (`mathematics`, `physics`, `economics`), diseases (`measles`, `mumps`), and some other words (`news`, `billiards`). <em>(e.g., 'The <strong>news is</strong> not true.' '<strong>Physics is</strong> a difficult subject.' '<strong>Measles causes</strong> a fever.')</em>",
                "<strong>Nouns Always Plural:</strong> Some nouns that refer to things with two parts are always plural, like `trousers`, `scissors`, `spectacles`, `goggles`, `pliers`. They take a plural verb. <em>(e.g., 'My new <strong>trousers are</strong> in the cupboard.' 'These <strong>scissors need</strong> sharpening.')</em> However, the phrase 'a pair of' makes the subject singular. <em>(e.g., 'A new <strong>pair</strong> of trousers <strong>is</strong> in the cupboard.')</em>",
                "<strong>Sentences with 'Here' or 'There':</strong> In sentences that begin with 'here' or 'there', the true subject follows the verb. The verb must agree with that subject. <em>(e.g., 'There <strong>is</strong> a <strong>problem</strong>.' vs. 'There <strong>are</strong> many <strong>problems</strong>.' 'Here <strong>comes</strong> the <strong>bus</strong>.' vs 'Here <strong>are</strong> the <strong>books</strong> you requested.')</em>",
                "<strong>Sums, Distances, and Periods:</strong> When expressions of time, money, or distance are used as a single unit, they take a singular verb. <em>(e.g., '<strong>Ten kilometres is</strong> a long way to walk.' '<strong>Five hundred rupees is</strong> a lot of money.' '<strong>Three hours seems</strong> like a long time to wait.')</em>",
                "<strong>'A number of' vs. 'The number of':</strong> The phrase 'a number of' is treated as plural, while 'the number of' is treated as singular. <em>(e.g., '<strong>A number of</strong> people <strong>were</strong> waiting.' vs. '<strong>The number of</strong> people waiting <strong>was</strong> large.' '<strong>A number of</strong> suggestions <strong>have</strong> been made.')</em>",
